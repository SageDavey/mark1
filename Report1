ðŸ§¾ Project Report: Robot Eye Animation and Expression Development
Project Goal:
To animate a robot face using servo motors, enabling expressive eye movement and eyelid control including blinking, squinting, and looking in various directions.

Hardware Setup:
Adafruit 16-channel PWM Servo Driver

6 servo motors:

1 for eye movement (both eyes)

1 for head tilt

2 for right eyelid (top and bottom)

2 for left eyelid (top and bottom)

Power: External 5V source connected to V+ and GND rails of the servo driver board

Controlled by: Arduino-compatible microcontroller

Servo Channel Assignments:

Channel	Function
0	Eye Movement
1	Head Tilt
2	Right Top Eyelid
3	Right Bottom Eyelid
4	Left Top Eyelid
5	Left Bottom Eyelid
Development Timeline and Key Changes:
âœ… Initial Setup and Debugging
Verified all servos were powered and connected correctly.

Identified servo 0 (eyes) and servo 1 (tilt) were swapped in interpretation â€” fixed.

Fixed servo calibration to match physical motion and orientation.

Corrected servo positions to compensate for eye drift (slight shift to the left).

Fixed eyelid open/close logic for both eyes â€” top and bottom lids required inverse behavior.

âœ… Blinking Mechanism
Implemented blinkEyes() function to animate eyelid closing and opening.

Adjusted servo values to ensure smooth, synchronized blinks.

Tuned blink duration to be servo-safe while still expressive.

âœ… Eye Movement
Implemented left, right, and center gaze movements.

Adjusted pulse widths to keep eye movement within a natural range.

Added return to center after motion for better realism.

âœ… Error Handling and Recovery
Diagnosed issues related to:

No servo response due to V+ power disconnect

Misassigned eyelid values causing servos to fully close or "freak out"

Inconsistent servo pulse widths and directions

Implemented a known-good baseline reset code to recover from unstable states.

âœ… Expression Expansion
Designed animation sequences:

Basic loop: blink â†’ look left â†’ look right â†’ blink again

Conceptual expressions like surprised and scrutinizing squint were prototyped.

Stable Baseline Features (Final Verified Code):
Smooth eye movement: Left, right, center

Working blink for both eyes with synchronized eyelid motion

Accurate return to center after blinks and gaze shifts

Easy-to-tune constants for each eyelid and eye behavior

Next Steps:
Refine facial expressions:

Add "surprised to be alive" with widened eyes and head tilt

Add "slow scrutinizing squint"

Implement expression queues for non-repetitive behavior

Add microphone or touch input to trigger specific expressions

Optionally expand to include mouth or eyebrow servos for fuller expression
